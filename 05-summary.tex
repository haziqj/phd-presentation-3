  \begin{itemize}\setlength\itemsep{0.8em}
    \item An extension of the I-prior methodology to binary responses.
    \item Variational inference used to approximate the intractable likelihood.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A deterministic approximation of the posterior density by a ``close'' (in the KL divergence sense), tractable density.
      \item It's somewhere between Laplace's method and MCMC sampling.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Several real-world examples demonstrated the use of I-probit models for classification and inference.
    \item Further work:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item R package \code{iprobit}
      \item Extend to multinomial probit models
      \item Expectation propagation?
    \end{itemize}
